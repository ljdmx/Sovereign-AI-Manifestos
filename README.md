# Sovereign-AI-Manifestos (v3.2)

Welcome to the **Sovereign-AI-Manifestos** repository. This project provides a structured ecosystem of AI behaviors, technical guidelines, and workflows designed to improve the reliability, architectural soundness, and aesthetic quality of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini.

By default, LLMs often produce generic boilerplate, overlook edge cases, and fail to maintain consistent architectural patterns across long context windows. This repository addresses these shortcomings by supplying explicit, RFC 2119-compliant protocols that act as guardrails and operational constraints for the AI.

## 🏗️ The Skill Ecosystem

This repository delegates software engineering responsibilities into three interlocking domains. When loaded into an AI agent framework, they force the model to adopt specialized personas rather than acting as a generic coding assistant.

### 1️⃣ Full-Stack Product Commander (FSPC)
**Role**: Product Orchestration & Delivery Management
FSPC acts as the central orchestrator, managing the project lifecycle from requirement gathering to deployment. It prevents premature code generation by enforcing strict planning phases.

*   **Strategic Advisory**: Adapts the AI's technical decisions based on explicit personas (Startup Founder, Growth Hacker, Enterprise Architect) to match the project's scale and business goals.
*   **Domain Intelligence & PRD Gate**: Halts scaffolding until a substantial data model (minimum 5 core entities) and a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD) are explicitly approved by the user.
*   **Architecture Briefing**: Requires the user to explicitly sign off on the chosen runtime, database, queue, and authentication topology before any actual code is written.
*   **Quantitative Quality Gates**: Integrates a unified validation CLI script (`validate.js`) to stringently check Lighthouse performance, A11y accessibility scores, security vulnerabilities (`npm audit`), and test coverage.
*   **Circuit Breakers & Sovereign Pivot**: Tracks consecutive build or test failures. Instead of infinite retry loops, the AI will halt, provide a root cause analysis, and formally propose a technology pivot or fallback strategy.

### 2️⃣ Design-Driven Frontend Manifesto (DDFM)
**Role**: UI/UX Engineering & Visual Consistency
DDFM replaces generic CSS utility classes and ad-hoc styling with a rigorous, mathematical approach to frontend design.

*   **Perceptually Uniform Color (OKLCH)**: Mandates the use of the OKLCH color space for predictive, linear contrast handling, effectively eliminating the need for manual dark-mode contrast overrides.
*   **Kinetic Physics & Frustration Awareness**: Defines explicit `stiffness/damping` parameters (e.g., 400/30) for spring animations. It includes rules to detect "rage clicks" and adapt the UI response (e.g., slowing down transitions and providing tooltips).
*   **Hardware-Aware Degradation**: Instructs the AI to write logic that detects low-tier hardware and gracefully degrades expensive rendering effects (like heavy backdrop-filters or 3D canvas rendering) to maintain a baseline 60 FPS.
*   **Finite State Machine (XState) Mandate**: Banned the use of complex boolean flags (`isLoading`, `hasError`) for component states with 6 or more intersection variants, enforcing formal state machines instead.
*   **Design Drift Detection**: Forces the AI to compare any newly generated CSS tokens against the last three delivered components to prevent UI inconsistency across long sessions.

### 3️⃣ API-Driven Backend Manifesto (ADBM)
**Role**: Backend Architecture & Enterprise Resiliency
ADBM ensures that generated backend code is not just functional, but built to handle concurrency, distributed failures, and stringent security requirements from Day 1.

*   **Saga Traceability & Idempotency**: Enforces distributed transaction patterns (like Saga) and requires `Idempotency-Key` headers on all state-mutating endpoints to prevent duplicate processing.
*   **Edge-First Sovereignty & mTLS**: Automatically suggests sidecar proxies and mutual TLS protocols for service-to-service communication in microservice architectures.
*   **DLQ Governance**: Implements clear routing and triage decision trees for Dead Letter Queues (DLQs), ensuring failed async jobs are monitored and handled correctly rather than silently dropped.
*   **Red Team Supply Chain Auditing**: Shifts security left by forcing dependency vulnerability scans (like `npm audit --json`) before the logic implementation phase, blocking generation if critical CVEs are detected.
*   **Multimodal Architecture Parsing (Divine Interface)**: A specialized sub-protocol guiding the AI on how to interpret user-uploaded system architecture diagrams, voice transcripts, or URL references, converting unstructured inputs into formal data models.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Dynamic Activation)

These skills are not meant to be read linearly by a human; they are optimized prompts for Agentic frameworks (e.g., Cline, Cursor, or custom Model Context Protocol agents).

1. **Triggering**: Place these folders into your AI's custom prompt/skills directory. When you use keywords like `build app`, `create API`, or `design system`, the AI's internal router will fetch the corresponding `SKILL.md`.
2. **Cross-Skill Inheritance**: FSPC acts as the root. In its `PRE-FLIGHT` phase, it explicitly commands the AI to read ADBM and DDFM, consolidating backend and frontend rules into a unified context.
3. **Kickoff Card**: Upon successful activation, the AI will output a structured Markdown "Kickoff Card" to the console. This card explicitly states the assigned persona, compliance tier, and specific active rules (e.g., `[Scale: Growth | Compliance: GDPR]`), allowing the user to audit the AI's technical assumptions before proceeding.

## 🔄 Lifecycle & Maintenance (Evolution Triggers)

To ensure longevity, the manifestos include "Evolution Triggers". For instance, the **Time-Based Decay** rule commands the AI: *If any referenced framework, tool, or library version mentioned in the documentation is more than 18 months old relative to the current date, the AI MUST flag the rule as `[STALE]` and propose an amendment.*
