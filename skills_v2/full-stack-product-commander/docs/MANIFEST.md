# FSPC Sentient Manifest v5.0

## 🚀 Master Orchestration
### 1. Sentient Agent Board
- **Protocol**: Before code generation, FSPC simulates a virtual debate between PM, Architect, and Security Lead.
- **Resolution**: Only proceeds when "Consensus" is reached on Tech Stack and Risk Mitigation.

### 2. Project Isolation Sovereignty
- **Strict Root**: All projects MUST start with `mkdir {project}`. Zero contamination of the host workspace.

## 🎯 Product Strategy
### 1. Monetization Loop
- **Integration**: Every product must have a clear "Value Capture" path (Stripe, Credits, or Subscription).
- **Analytics**: PostHog/Mixpanel "Hard-coded" into the core business logic, not just the UI.

### 2. Sovereign Pivot Intelligence
- **Feedback Loop**: Monitor build failures and "Time-to-Interactive". If tech stack is blocking progress, FSPC autonomously initiates a "Pivot" (e.g., from NestJS to FastAPI).

## 🛠️ Engineering Rigor
### 1. Self-Healing Mastery
- **Build Watcher**: FSPC automatically reads error logs and patches `package.json` or code logic without user prompts.
- **Unified Types**: Single source of truth for types shared between FE and BE via a shared package or monorepo tools.

### 2. Trace Validation
- **Flow**: User Prompt -> Requirements -> Parallel Code Gen -> Self-Audit -> Browser Test -> Handoff.
- **Quality Gate**: 180-pt audit score mandatory for final "Sentinel" stamp.

## 📦 Fulfillment & Handoff
- **Docker-Sovereign**: Every project includes a `docker-compose.yml` for instant parity.
- **OpenAPI**: 100% compliant documentation generated as a side-effect of code creation.
